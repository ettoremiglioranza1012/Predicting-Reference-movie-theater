# Predicting Reference movie theater 

Dataset provided by Professor Ernesto D'avanzo, University of Trento. Professor D'avanzo, dean of the marketing course, provided the students with a dataset and asked us to do a descriptive analysis of the data. Knowing my proficiency with python, the professor specifically asked me to create a model to predict the reference cinema. 
I used a RandomForestClassifier with multilabel classification. The code has many imperfections that I am aware of and am currently correcting.
